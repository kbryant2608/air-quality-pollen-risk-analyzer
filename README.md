# 🌿 Air Quality & Pollen Risk Analyzer

**Client-style data project simulating a public health dataset cleanup and analysis.**

This project transforms messy environmental data into clean, decision-ready insights through time-based engineering, severity classification, and trend discovery.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Cleaned and enriched a real-world dataset with air quality and pollen data
- Engineered time-based and severity-level features
- Handled missing values using context-aware imputation
- Visualized trends and relationships to support public health insights
